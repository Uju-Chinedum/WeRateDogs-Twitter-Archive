> WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. People may want to buy dogs that are humorous or otherwise. The goal of the project is to analyze and know the humour level of each breed of dog. Each dog is rated differently based on humour level with a common rating denominator of 10 but with _weird_ levels of rating numerator, some higher than 10, but that is all part of the fun of the [`@dog_rates`](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) twitter account. From the description of the project, some ratings in the `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv` were not accurately pulled from the `text` and thus revisiting had to be done.

> Only eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues, at minimum, were to be identified and addressed due to the robustness of the data.
